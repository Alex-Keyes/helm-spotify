* Helm Spotify

A simple Emacs interface for Spotify that makes good use of helm.

* Usage

=M-x helm-spotify= and type a search string.

=C-n= and =C-p= will move through the track list.
=RET= plays the track.
=TAB= lists more options.

* Status

A Sunday lunchtime hack. It works for me. You're welcome to use
it. It's OSX only.
