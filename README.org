A simple Emacs interface for Spotify that makes good use of helm.

* Video

See how [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjKtkEMUYGc&feature=youtu.be][the first version was coded in 16 minutes]].

* Usage

=M-x helm-spotify= and type a search string.

=C-n= and =C-p= will move through the track list.
=RET= plays the track.
=TAB= lists more options.

* Status

Ready to use. Currently OSX & Linux only.

* Supporting Other Platforms

Find out what emacs says your =system-type= is. (=C-h v system-type=).
Let's say it returns =ms-dos=. Then you need to write this function:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defmulti-method spotify-play-href 'ms-dos
  (href)
  ...
  ... href will be a string that's something like "spotify:track:5Yt80fWRB8JG73XlPjrrKP"
  ...
  ... here, you write any code that will cause Spotify to play that href.
  ...
  )
#+END_SRC
